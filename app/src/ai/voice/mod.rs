// Zap Wave 6-1: `pub(crate) mod transcribe` is physically removed along with `ServerApi::transcribe`.
// The submodule `transcribe/api/{request,response}` was only the wire types for the deleted cloud `/ai/transcribe` endpoint.
// Local voice goes through the `voice/transcriber.rs::Transcriber` trait + `TranscribeError`.
